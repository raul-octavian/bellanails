 * client's token link, a signed-in page — so each entry should be a decision.
 * Typed as `Route`, so renaming a route breaks the build here rather than
 * quietly dropping a page out of the index.
 *
 * Deliberately left out:
 * - `/book`, `/confirmation`, `/request-sent` — steps inside a flow, and a
 *   confirmation belongs to one booking.
 * - `/appointments` and its reschedule route — signed in only.
 * - `/login` — nothing to rank.
 * - `/ask` — a personal enquiry form, and already `robots: index: false`.
 *   Listing a noindex page is a contradiction a crawler will report back.
 * - `/approve`, `/manage`, `/offer`, `/testimonial` — one person's signed link.
 * - `/services/[id]` — the detail pages have no sections, gallery or reviews
 *   yet, so indexing them would submit five thin near-duplicates of the menu.
 *   They belong here the day they have content.
 * - `/styleguide` — internal.
